LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data.

To retrieve the data that powers this app, AJAX requests are sent to the Twitter, Spotify and IMDB APIs.
